This is a collection of cheats for learning game platforms like Kahoot or Blooket. <br>
Also, I did not make these cheats, I found them through searching the web and repositories. <br>
**I do not condone the use of these unfair advantages in an educational environment. This can ruin the experience for others and it is best to play with integrity when learning.**

Try putting these links in a proxy if they are blocked. It probably won't work, but it's worth a try.
## **RECOMMENDED**: Cheat Hubs
The ultimate hub for every learning game platform, used for Kahoot, Gimkit, Blooket, Brainly (bypass exercise limit), and more! <br>

2. Then join the quizizz again, or start another attempt. **Run script** and you are done! <br>
